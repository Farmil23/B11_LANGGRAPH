      "[{\"title\": \"Your AI Update - January 2024 | News\", \"url\": \"https://altech.nd.edu/events-news/news/your-ai-update-january-2024/\", \"content\": \"a market-challenging AI chatbot developed by Microsoft that is intended to be integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite of products. Initially launched last February as ‘Bing Chat,’ the product has undergone many changes on its way to being Microsoft’s flagship AI product. Similarly, Google is integrating its Quantum technologies into its Chrome browser and ad services, two cornerstone elements of their business now receiving AI upgrades. [...] Since Midjourney released its groundbreaking AI image generator in June 2022, we’ve all been wondering when AI’s capabilities would extend to replicate video and organic sound, music, and speech. In early January, Midjourney announced precisely what has been so long anticipated, a ‘text-to-video generator,’ to be released in the coming months. Shortly after, CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman confirmed that video generation capabilities will be coming to ChatGPT within a year or so. Microsoft also broke ground by announcing Copilot’s compatibility with an extension called Suno, a plug-in that enables users to create songs based on text prompts. Google contributed to the frenzy by announcing VideoPoet, a large language model (LLM) that can generate video. As with any stride in AI capability, other [...] generate video. As with any stride in AI capability, other problems like perpetuating the web’s misinformation remain to be evaluated. Currently, only brief (several seconds) video generation is widely available through Meta’s Emu, Stability AI’s Stable Video Diffusion, and Runway’s suite of video and image tools.\", \"score\": 0.9993487}, {\"title\": \"AI 2024 in review: The 10 most notable AI stories of the year\", \"url\": \"https://iot-analytics.com/ai-2024-10-most-notable-stories/\", \"content\": \"New features make up for limited LLM progress. Though model progress may be plateauing, AI companies are still working to bring added value to their current models. For example, OpenAI released the preview of its o1 and o1-mini models in September 2024 and fully released them in December 2024 (along with introducing its upcoming o3 model). While the o1 model takes longer to process a query, it works through “chains of thought” to construct and correct its answers before responding (much like a human would take time to break down a complex problem), enhancing its reasoning abilities and answer accuracy. [...] Japan and Brazil also introduced AI regulations. While the EU AI Act is touted as the first of its kind, countries elsewhere have either initiated legislation for regulating AI or offered guidelines that align with existing laws but are not aimed to be as governing as the EU AI Act. For example, in Asia, Japan’s government published the AI Guidelines for Business 1.0, a voluntary guideline based on existent laws meant to encourage responsible AI development and use, in April 2024. Meanwhile, in South America, Brazil’s senate introduced Bill No. 2338/2024, its first bill intended to regulate AI (including algorithm design and technical standards), in May 2024 and passed it in December 2024. [...] Microsoft acquires Inflection’s tech and team. On March 19, 2024, Microsoft established a new consumer AI division called Microsoft AI. In staffing this division, Microsoft hired Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, co-founders of US-based AI startup Inflection AI, as well as most of Inflection AI’s team. Further, Microsoft entered into a series of commercial agreements with Inflection AI, including nonexclusive licensing to use Inflection AI’s intellectual property (among other deals).\", \"score\": 0.99805814}, {\"title\": \"2024: A year of extraordinary progress and advancement in AI\", \"url\": \"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/2024-ai-extraordinary-progress-advancement/\", \"content\": \"In December 2024, we released the first models in our Gemini 2.0 experimental series — AI models designed for the agentic era.
